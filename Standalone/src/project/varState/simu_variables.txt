% Definition of the simulation variables and I/O ports
% For each line: varname , type , size/str_type
% 4 types of simulation variables (simu_vars_none,...)
%       . NONE   : internal variable (type: int/double)
%       . IN     : input (type: int/double)
%       . OUT    : output (type: int/double)
%       . STRUCT : structure variable (type: structure name without '' or "")
%   - varname = name of the variable (without '' or "")
%   - size = number of elements in the vector
%               (put 1 for STRUCT)
%           (1: simple varibale,  >1: vector -> do not use the 0 index -> different from 'control_variables')

% Lines starting with % or // are not taken into account (comments)

% Do modify the lines # NONE, # IN, # OUT, # STRUCT or add another line starting with #
